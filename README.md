# Mentor-Course-Assignment-Problem
Operations Research project
The problem is to optimize the allocation of mentors to subjects in a school in order to maximize
the overall effectiveness of the educational program. The goal is to find the best match between
mentors and subjects. This can be achieved using the assignment problem, a mathematical
technique that involves matching a set of resources (mentors) to a set of tasks (subjects) in a way
that maximizes overall effectiveness.
